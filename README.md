directory_organizer
===================

A python script to read files in a directory and organize them into folders.

Will read all files of the given type in the given directory. Creates new folders in that directory named from the creation date of the files. Moves all the files into the directory that matches their creation date.

Also, just a quick and simple project so that I can learn some python ;)
